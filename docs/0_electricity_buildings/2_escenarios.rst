Scenarios
---------------------

The energy sector is assessed under two distinct scenarios: the Business-As-Usual (BAU) scenario
and the Long-Term Strategy (LTS) scenario. The BAU scenario follows Jamaica's 2018 Integrated Resource Plan,
meeting growing energy demand through a mix of conventional and intermittent renewable sources, with no significant
improvements in transmission losses, energy efficiency, or electrification of cooking. In contrast, the LTS scenario
envisions a fully renewable energy system by 2050, with substantial reductions in transmission and distribution losses,
widespread adoption of energy-efficient technologies, electrification of cooking, and extensive use of energy storage to
support intermittent renewables. Long-Term Strategy (LTS) Actions. 

The actions modelled on the LTS scenario are:

1.	Deploy Intermittent Renewables
Up until 2038, the strategy aligns with the 2018 Jamaica Integrated Resource Plan.
By 2050, the energy mix is projected to consist entirely of intermittent renewables.

2.	Reduce System Losses
Transmission and distribution (T&D) losses will be reduced to 8% by 2050.

3.	Energy Storage with Batteries
By 2038, 540 MW of battery energy storage systems (BESS) will be installed. By 2050,
BESS will account for 22% of the total installed capacity of power plants.

4.	Energy Demand Growth
Growth rates are according to Jamaica’s GDP.

5.	Cookers Electrification
  o	By 2035, kerosene, wood, and charcoal stoves will be replaced with electrical options.
  o	By 2050, no new LPG cookers will be in the market, and their use will be reduced to 9% of the BAU scenario.

6.	Energy Efficiency in Existing Buildings
  o	By 2030, solar water heating will replace 2% of traditional heaters, and 3% by 2050, relative to BAU.
  o	In 2030, replace 100% of electric lighting with LED lamps (1,177,626 units), or equivalents, in residential, public, and commercial buildings.
  o	In 2040, replace electrical units in existing buildings, relative to 2021:
    • 1,178,797 refrigeration units
    • 17,925 air conditioning (AC) units.
